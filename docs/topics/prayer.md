### Jesus's advice about praying
1. Never make a big show about praying (*Matthew 6:5-6*)
2. Do not worry about the world. (*Matthew 6:7-8*)
3. Persevere. "Ask and you shall receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened to you"
(*Luke 11:9*)

### Jesus' model of prayer (The Lord's prayer/Our Father)

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
