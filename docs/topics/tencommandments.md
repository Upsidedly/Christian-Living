>
> Old Covenant: God called Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt's enslavement and to Mount Sinai, where God forged a covenant with them. He was made their God, and they were made His people. The blood of an animal was used to seal the covenant, and God gave Moses the Ten Commandments to help the Israelites live in His way. The Israelites' passage through the Red Sea was a pivotal point in their journey to freedom from slavery. The Israelites commemorate God's rescue efforts and renew their bond with Him during the Passover feast. God provided manna to His people to sustain them on their journey to the Promised Land.

> New Covenant: Jesus was sent into the world to deliver all people from the shackles of sin. We are all called to be God's people and to live as God's children via Jesus. Jesus established the New Covenant through his blood and gave the people a new commandment to love others as He loves us through his life, death, and resurrection. The waters of Baptism symbolize a pivotal point for the people of the new covenant, as we are set free from the slavery of sin via Baptism. We recall our own "passover" experience as we recall how Jesus bore the consequences of our sin in His life, death, and resurrection. This is known as the Eucharist in various denominations. The Eucharist is the food (host) that offers strength to several Christian faiths in their daily attempts to follow Jesus. The Eucharist is the food (host) that strengthensÂ some Christian denominations in their daily efforts to follow Jesus.
