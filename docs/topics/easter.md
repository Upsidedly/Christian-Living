# Easter

> Easter is the celebration and rememberance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  
> The story of resurrection is found at [Luke 24:1-12](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/LUK.24.1-12).

It begins on Easter Sunday and lasts for a period of 50 days.

Mary Magdalene is considered a primary witness of the ressurrection due to, alongside Joanna and Mary, mother of James, was the first to see Jesus after he had risen. Her story is found in **all four gospels.**

Many disciples found it hard to believe her story, especially Thomas, who said

> "Unless I see the mark of nails in his hand and put my finger into the nail marks and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."

One week later when Jesus, risen, appeared to the disciples, he stated to Thomas,

> "Put your finger here and see my hands and bring your hand and put it into my side and do not be unbelieving but believe."

When Thomas did this, he said

> "My Lord and My God" ([John 20:25](), 27-28)
