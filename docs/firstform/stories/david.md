## David is Anointed as King by Samuel

Samuel was a judge and widely recognized as a prophet. He persuaded Israel to stop worshipping other gods and to worship God alone. In return God thwarted many attacks by the Philistines.

The Israelites saw that the nations surrounding them had kings. They were jealous and wanted their own king. Samuel was not pleased as he felt he was being rejected. However God pointed out to him that by asking for a king the people had not rejected Samuel, but had rejected God. Even after being warned of disadvantages related to having a king the people insisted that they still wanted the king. God gave permission for Samuel to select a king. Samuel told the people that as long as they were obedient to God, they would not be punished for requesting a king.

God told Samuel who to choose as the king. God assured Saul through signs that he was to be king. Samuel poured oil over Saul’s head to anoint him as king.

Saul was a good king at first. He had many victories in war, guided by God. However he soon disobeyed God then tried to make up for it by offering sacrifice to God. Samuel rebuked Saul. He informed Saul that God would choose another man to be king of Israel.

God led Samuel to the town of Bethlehem to choose a new king. The king would come from Jesse’s family. Each of Jesse’s older sons was presented to Samuel. All were impressive, but God told Samuel not to judge by their external appearances but, rather, by their hearts. Samuel asked Jesse to bring his youngest son in from tending the sheep. **Samuel anointed Jesse’s youngest son, David, a shepherd, as king.**

(Read the full story of the anointing: 1 Samuel 1:16)

God withdrew his power from Saul, cursing Saul with emotional/mental distress in the form of an “evil spirit”. Saul sent for someone to play the harp for him to comfort him. David was the harp-player. Through this event David began his rise to eventually become king.

## David and Goliath

The story of David and Goliath is one of most popular stories from the Bible. It is a lesson of courage and faith. It teaches us about overcoming what seems impossible with the help of God.

One day, the nation of Israel was called to fight the Philistine army that had gathered for war.

David's brothers went with King Saul to fight. As the youngest of Jesse's twelve sons, David was too young to go to war so he stayed behind.

The two armies gathered to stand on opposite sides of a deep valley. A Philistine giant named Goliath who was over nine feet tall mocked the Israelites and their God. Goliath wanted them to fight but King Saul and the Israelites were scared and did nothing.

David was sent by his father Jesse to visit the front lines, deliver food, and bring back news of the battle from his brothers.

David heard Goliath mocking Israel and their God. David was brave and volunteered to fight Goliath. He persuaded King Saul to let him fight. He decided to not wear any of King Saul's armour as he was not used to it. The armour was too big and heavy. David carried his slingshot and gathered five smooth stones.

Goliath laughed at David but David responded that even though Goliath had a sword and spear, he David, came in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel. David put a stone in his slingshot and swung the stone at Goliath's head. The stone hit Goliath on his forehead and he fell. David then used Goliath's own sword to cut off Goliath’s head.

The Philistines ran away when they saw Goliath killed. Israel had won the battle because of David's faith and trust in God

## David and Bathsheba

The story of David and Bathsheba reminds us that even great men who are called by God are still humans and struggle with sin. King David was a good king who did his best to follow God's laws.

One day when his soldiers went to war David stayed home in Jerusalem. While walking on the palace roof, David looked across and saw a beautiful, woman bathing on her roof. David asked who she was and was told that she was Bathsheba, the wife of one of his soldiers, called Uriah. Even though he knew she was married David sent for her and slept with her. She became pregnant. Afraid that his adultery would be found out, David had Uriah sent home so that he could spend a night with his wife and cover up the sin that she was pregnant with David's child.

However, the plan failed because Uriah was an honourable man who refused to sleep with his wife while his fellow soldiers were fighting a war. Davis therefore made a new plan. He instructed the commander of his army to put Uriah at the frontline in the fiercest battle and then withdraw. Uriah was killed in the battle.

After mourning Uriah, Bathsheba became David’s wife.

David received a visit from the prophet Nathan. Nathan told David a story about a rich man and a poor man. The rich man had many sheep. The poor man had only one. The rich man took the poor man's sheep and killed it for a feast. David was enraged and stated that the rich man should be punished. Nathan pointed out to him that he, David was the rich man. He had been given much by God including wives and children. Yet he had taken Uriah's life in order to gain possession of his wife. Nathan told David of the Lord's disapproval and displeasure.

David was sorry and repented. However, even though David repented of his sin, Nathan told David that the son that he had with Bathsheba who was conceived in adultery would die.

David was dismayed and grieved while his son was ill. However when his soon died he accepted the punishment he received.

David and Bathsheba eventually had another son named Solomon who would eventually become king.
